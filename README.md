This is a simple implementation of the Bit-fixing Correlation Attack on Random Local Functions based on C++.
Due to time constraints, optimization techniques such as parallel computing and sparse matrix Gaussian elimination have not been implemented. These features will be added in the future.
The key demonstrated in the code is the hashed value of "EUROCRYPTO2025" using the standard SHA-256 function.
Use output.cpp to generate a large number of outputs for the attack. Once the outputs are generated, use attack.cpp to perform the attack.
